# Crypto Address Lab

## Overview
"Crypto Address Lab" is a project designed for blockchain developers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This repository focuses on generating keys for the ICON blockchain network, providing methods to create private and public keys using different Python libraries.

## Files
1. **create_icon_keys_with_coincurve.py**: Uses the `coincurve` library to generate private and public keys for the ICON blockchain.
2. **create_icon_keys_with_ecdsa.py**: Uses the `ecdsa` library to generate private and public keys for the ICON blockchain.

## Usage
Each file can be executed independently. Necessary libraries are specified at the top of each script. Ensure to install these libraries before using the scripts.

### Installing Required Libraries
```bash
pip install coincurve
pip install ecdsa
```

### Running the Scripts
```bash
python create_icon_keys_with_coincurve.py
python create_icon_keys_with_ecdsa.py

```
